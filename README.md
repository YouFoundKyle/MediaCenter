# Self-Hosted Services #

Acts as a colletion of all self hosted services running on docker.


docker-based plex & usenet media server using custom subdomains with tls

## Motivation

- host each service as a subdomain of a personal domain over https
- run public maintained images with no modifications
- require minimal configuration and setup

## Services

### Publicly facing
- [Plex](https://hub.docker.com/r/plexinc/pms-docker) - organizes video, music and photos from personal media libraries and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices. This container is packaged as a standalone Plex Media Server.
- [Ombi](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/ombi/) - Allows you to host your own Plex Request and user management system.
- [Nextcloud](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/ombi/) - A full-fledged open-source replacement for Google Suite or Microsoft 365. 
### Backend
- [Traefik](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik/) - a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.
- [qBittorrent](https://hub.docker.com/r/binhex/arch-qbittorrentvpn) - An fast and stable bittorrent client that provides many featurues. This includes in OpenVPN instance based on arch linux that proxies all network requests.  
- [Grafana](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana/) - Solution for visualizing analytics & simplifying monitoring. 
- [Prometheus](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/) - Systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. Collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to be true
- [Mysql](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) - Leading open-source database used for storing metrics
- [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) -Community-developed fork of the MySQL used to store NextCloud Data. 

### Automation
- [Sonarr](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/sonarr/) - (formerly NZBdrone) is a PVR for usenet and bittorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.
- [Radarr](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/radarr/) - A fork of Sonarr to work with movies Ã  la Couchpotato.

- `grafana.domain.local`
- `prometheus.domain.local`
- `sonarr.domain.local`
- `radarr.domain.local`
- `hydra.domain.local`
- `qbit.domain.local`
